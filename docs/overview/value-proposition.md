---

- __Speed__: GPU acceleration and vectorized CPU paths from one code base.
- __Productivity__: No need to manually rewrite kernels in C++/CUDA.
- __Portability__: Keep your .NET/Java code; target diverse hardware.
- __Maintainability__: Fewer language boundaries; debug with line info support.
- __Trust__: Deterministic compilation pipeline, explicit attributes/annotations.
